Py-Game physics example.

A basic block/sprite. 
Move with controls A, D
No jumping. But you can jump off the platform.

This is just some sort of basic idea that I have for developing games. 
First time messing/creating something with pygame

I'm going to take my game development route into Tile-Baised games. Easier to handle.
Hence why i'm releasing this.
